According to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), heart disease is one of the leading causes of death for most people in the United States, and about half of Americans (47%) have at least one of three key risk factors for heart disease: high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and smoking. Other key indicators include diabetic status, obesity (high BMI), not getting enough physical activity or drinking too much alcohol. Because of the prevalence of heart disease, I decided to build a model to predict heart disease based on some of the most common and influential predictors. This model could predict whether an individual has heart disease so they can receive the necessary treatment to reduce the burden of their condition. You can find more details of my work [here](https://github.com/minhtranmba/heart_disease_model_prediction/blob/main/Model_to_predict_heart_disease.ipynb).<br>

This data set has around <b>319,800 rows</b> and <b>18 variables</b>: 9 boolean, 5 string, and 4 decimal. 
<ul>
    <li>The booleans include the presence of heart disease, smoking, heavy drinking, stroke, skin cancer, asthma, diabetes, and kidney cancer.</li>
    <li>The strings include sex, race, and general health.</li>
    <li>The decimals include sleep time, bad physical health days in a month, and bad mental health days in a month.</li>
</ul>
From the data, the dependent variable (y) I'm trying to predict is HeartDisease, and the rest are feature variables.
